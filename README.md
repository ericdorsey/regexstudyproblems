### Match Times or "n/a"
> Beginner regex question, example within
> I have the text:

Given
```
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"3pm - 7pm"
```
> and want to match the 3pm - 7pm portion only. 
> In other cases, this portion would be marked as "n/a" and I would want to match that instead. 

(From https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/f0i29z/beginner_regex_question_example_within/)

#### Goal
Match and Capture `3pm - 7pm`, allowing for other times too, like `10am - 2pm` 

If `n/a` appears instead of the time range in the quotes, match & capture that instead 

#### Text To Test Against
```
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"3pm - 7pm"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"n/a"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"10am - 2pm"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"9pm - 3am"
```

#### Bonus
Match and Capture each time (ie, `3pm` and `7pm`) distinctly

### Match Title, Edition, Author

Can we somehow use the fact that that the thing we care about starts at the 19th character? ie:  

cV7B4E9F0405lp6b7S&#8594;181865969kr9sl3Z586i2K64d2

Can we still Match & Capture `18186596` from the first row, `62159744` from the 2nd, etc? 

### Match Only Subdomains
Given:
```
foo.mydomain.com
mydomain.com
set user settings at user.mydomain.com/settings
signup.mydomain.com
google.com
hello.net
whatever.mydomain.net
what if we're testing.mydomain.com
```

#### Goal
Match only the subdomains of `mydomain.com`, such as `foo` and `testing`, etc.

### Picky 'm' Matching
Given:
```
m is
the .m. filter
is m the 
m is
the 'm filter
the m. filter
the .m filter

the m. bison filter
the i'm filter
the them filter
```
(From https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/f1uovo/a_regex_filter_with_a_bunch_of_different/)

#### Goal
Match and capture only the `m`'s in the first seven lines, but nothing (and certainly not the `m`'s!) in the last 3 lines.

### "Select the Definite Article and the Indefinite Articles"
Given:
> I need to select "The" or "the", "An" or "an", and "A" or "a" in a paragraph, without selecting these letters in the middle of a word.

(From https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/f0m8y0/regex_to_select_the_definite_article_and_the/)

#### Goal
Match and capture `the`, `The`, `an`, `An`, `a` or `A` (don't match if these appear inside other words) in the below:
```
Now is the time.
The quick brown fox had a bad day.
Theodore took a long time.
Theodore took an long time.
Theodore took the long time.
A stitch in time.
An extraordinary day.
The extraordinary day.
```

But not below (`a`, `an`, `the` should not match within `Another`):
```
Another time
Bad syntax the.
Bad syntax a.
Bad syntax an.
Bad syntax the
Bad syntax a
Bad syntax an
```

### Fix Your Boss's Ugly Notes
Your boss comes to you with some monthly bills tracking they've been doing in `Notepad.exe`. But the problem is your boss has 
been really inconsistent with the formatting! Your boss said they sometimes added a `*` to some entries, but they don't remember
why, so it's safe to just get rid of that. Also, your boss wasn't very consistent with format, sometimes using `mo.`, or a `/`
instead of a space between the dollar amount and month. And sometimes the exact amount including cents isn't there, just the 
dollar amount. They want each dollar & cents amount printed out, followed by a comma, folowed by "monthly", followed by a comma, 
then "for {purpose}". 

Can you help clean this up? 

```
$65.37 mo. Internet
*$114 month Phone
$10 mo Netflix
$750/mon. Mortgage
*$8.40/month Spotify
```

#### Goal
```
$65.37, monthly, for Internet
$114, monthly, for Phone
$10, monthly, for Netflix
$750, monthly, for Mortgage
$8.40, monthly, for Spotify
```

### Grab The Font Family Name From A URL
Given:

> The regex should extract everything between ...family=<what I want>

```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:300,300i,400,400i,700,700i&display=swap

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed+word:300,300i,400,400i,700,700i&display=swap

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed&display=swap

what if it's in the middle https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed of some other text, though? 

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap

What if the font is in the middle of other text and has more parts to it https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed+Radical+Hurray and still followed by some other text?

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Rad+Okay+Zoom+Derp+Test+Okay+Eight+Starbucks+Bold&display=swap
```

### Regex Pattern To Account For All The Options In A Config File
Given:

> Using Python 3.7, I'm writing a script to parse out options from a config file

```
# a_commented_out_option_with_no_value =
an_enabled_binary_option = false
an_enabled_binary_option = "true"
# a_commented_out_binary_option = true
an_integer_option = 1
a_decimal_option = 1.1
a_string_option = "with-quotes"
another_string_option = withoutquotes
a_path_option = "/path/to/file1.txt"
a_really_really_really_really_long_option = "sigh"
```

#### Goal
Match and capture both the configuration option, and configuration value from the text above (but don't capture quotes (`"`) if present in the config values).

Example desired match / capture output from above (note that in the first config option, `a_commented_out_option_with_no_value`, there is no config value to be captured, so only capture the config option itself in this case):

```
a_commented_out_option_with_no_value 
an_enabled_binary_option false
an_enabled_binary_option true
a_commented_out_binary_option true
an_integer_option 1
a_decimal_option 1.1
a_string_option with-quotes
another_string_option withoutquotes
a_path_option /path/to/file1.txt
a_really_really_really_really_long_option sigh
```

### Match Certain c's and v's Followed by Numbers

> Need a regex in python to match c/v or both and a number between 1-5 but im struggling a little.

Given:

Examples of matching strings:

```

```

#### Goal
Match and capture `c` followed by a digit in the range of 1 through 5, or `v` followed by a digit in the range of 1 through 5, or `cv` or `vc` followed by a digit in the range of 1 through 5. Don't match if preceded by an extra `c` or `v`, and don't match if 

(use examples of matching and non matching above)

(From: https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/fd7i20/basic_python_matching_regex_help/)

### Match Letters With Spaces

> Letters with spaces
> I know its quite easy stuff but I dont work with regex much. Say I want something like "e e e e e" to be caught by the rule, how would I do it? "e e e" and " e e e e e e e e " could get caught in the rule aswell.

Examples of matching strings:

```
e e e e e
e e e
b b b
e e e e e e e e
a a a
z z z
```

Examples of non matching strings:

```
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ee
eeeeeeeee

```

#### Goal
Match and capture the price and vendor in the above lines (ie, $15.99 and "NETFLIX.COM" from the first line)

(From: https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/fr8jlr/trying_to_remove_everything_except_price_1599_and/)

### Match Full Path Up To, But Not After, Final Forward Slash

Given 
```
/path/to/directory/is/3xtre3ml3y/l0ng/it/w0n/t/st0o/p/all/the/time
/path/to/l0ng/it/direct0ry/w0n/t/st0o/p/all/the/-279
/path/to/directory/is/3xtre3ml3y/l0ng/it/w0n/t/st0p/a/even/longer/path/?foo
/short/one/barbaz
```

#### Goal
Match and capture up until the last `/`, but nothing after it. 

For example, in line one, match and capture `/path/to/directory/is/3xtre3ml3y/l0ng/it/w0n/t/st0o/p/all/the/`

(From: https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/fpk97s/pulling_directory_path_it_trails_on_some_paths/)

### Get Only Numbers and "EUR" or "EURO"
