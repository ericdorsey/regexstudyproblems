### Match Times or "n/a"

```
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"3pm - 7pm"

(From https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/f0i29z/beginner_regex_question_example_within/)

#### Goal
* Match `3pm - 7pm`, allowing for other times too, like `10am - 2pm`
* If `n/a` appears in the quotes, match that instead 

#### Example Match Text
```
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"3pm - 7pm"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"n/a"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"10am - 2pm"
"openingHoursMonday";s:9:"9pm - 3am"
```
